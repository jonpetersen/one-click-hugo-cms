  heading: Electric Bike Tour Route
  description: >
    This route of around 22 miles (35km) starts by leaving Hambledon on a quiet country road where you can get used to your bike. Then heads into the woods south of Dunsfold, before following the Wey & Arun canal north through some wonderful quiet countryside to the Three Compasses pub. From there we'll head north to do a circuit of Hascombe Hill ending at The White Horse. Finally we'll climb up onto the Greensand Way to return to Hambledon.
