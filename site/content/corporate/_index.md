intro:
  heading: Team Building on Bikes
  description: >
    A guided bike tour or a bicycle treasure hunt is a great way to have your team enjoy exercise, fresh air and fun.
blurb:
    heading: Off Road Tours
    text: "We can put together a mostly off-road guided tour that will take in some of the most beautiful countryside in Southern England, together with a local winery or brewery tour. If the group is of mixed cycling ability they can use a mixture of pure pedal powered bikes and electric bikes."
blurb2:
    heading: Bicycle Treasure Hunts
    text: "We split your group into teams, each team then gets a map and a series of questions to answer. Teams must then plan their route to get to as many map locations as quickly they can and at each location answer the relevant question. Teams return to the end point (The Merry Harriers Pub in Hambledon), by a fixed time, for refreshments and prize giving."
