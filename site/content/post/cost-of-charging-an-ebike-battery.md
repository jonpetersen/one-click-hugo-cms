  The short answer: not a lot.

Sometimes we'll take advantage of a coffee stop to top up the bike battery on a mountain bike. If it's been a long day with lots of climbing and the rider has been seduced by turbo mode, then a bit of extra juice to get home is nice insurance. We'll always ask for permission to plug in and, understandably, are often asked what effect we'll have on the establishments electricity bill.

Our Cube Hybrid electric mountain bikes use the Bosch Performance Line CX drive units with a 36 volt 500 watt battery (the most powerful available). The 36 volt compact charger which we take out with us, provides 2 amps of current, so thats 72 (2 x 36) watts of power or 0.072 kilowatt hours (kwh) of power. In the UK the cost of electricity is around 15p per kwh, so the cost of charging for an hour is just 0.072 x 15 = 1.08p. No battery charger is 100% efficient so this cost calculation will be slightly on the low side, but even so, the profit from our coffee should cover it. Even if we were to stay for the 7.5 hours required for a full charge, the electricity cost would be around 8p.
